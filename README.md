# world-language-comparator

https://stonecrafter.github.io/world-language-comparator/

Translate from any one language to any number of other languages, in one go, and on one screen. Built off of [this](https://github.com/stonecrafter/nordic-language-comparator/), but with more features and general applicability.

Yandex was chosen as the translation API because, Google does not have a free tier, and Bing does not support nearly as many languages.

#### TODOs
1. Error handling and message display
2. Unit tests
3. Add backend server (for local hosting of fonts, etc)
