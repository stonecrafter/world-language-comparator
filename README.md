# world-language-comparator

https://stonecrafter.github.io/world-language-comparator/

Translate from any one language to any number of other languages, in one go, and on one screen. Built off of [this](https://github.com/stonecrafter/nordic-language-comparator/), but with more features and general applicability.

Yandex was chosen as the translation API because, Google does not have a free tier, and Bing does not support nearly as many languages.

### Status April 2021

Yandex.Translate's free tier has been disabled and thus, unfortunately, my API key (and the whole of this site) does not work anymore. I may at some point investigate other machine translation services with free API keys, but at this moment, learning other human languages isn't my main priority.

This project was how I taught myself React and Sass, so feel free to still browse around the code itself if you're curious about the details of that process back when it happened.
