# nordic-language-comparator

https://stonecrafter.github.io/nordic-language-comparator/

Enter some English text to see translations in 5 Nordic languages side by side.

This is a small spin-off of a larger project that I have in mind.

#### Future project plans
1. Ability to select any from-language and 0 < x <= 10 number of to-languages
2. Drag and drop reordering of to-languages
3. Save to-language selection in session storage so they are preserved for the user on page reload
4. Loading spinner or indicator while translations are returning from API
5. Temporary sharable link to a particular set of translated results (maybe)
6. etc
